 # :star2:**NC-NEWS**:star2:

  NC News is an api that interacts with my NC News website. The  database for this project is PSQL, and we interact with it using Knex.

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Step 1 - Setting up your own repository
Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone (https://github.com/achugs/be-nc-news.git)

cd be-nc-news
```

On GitHub create your own **public** repository for your project. **Make sure NOT to initialise it with a README or .gitignore.**

Next, you should hook your local version up to the newly created GitHub repo. Use the following terminal commands, making sure to check the git remotes with each step (`git remote -v`):

```bash
git remote remove origin

# This will prevent you from pushing to the original repo.
```

```bash
git remote add origin <YOUR-GITHUB-URL>

# This will add your GitHub location to your local git repository.
# You can confirm this by checking the new git remote.
```
